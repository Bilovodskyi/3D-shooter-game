# Demo
Below you can find a demo of this project. Currently, I am rendering the map in the browser using react-three-fiber, adding physics (gravity and collisions) with the react-three/rapier library, and including a player. (I'm just learning Blender, and my skills aren't yet sufficient to create characters in Blender, so I found one on the internet. I promise to improve this in future projects. ðŸ˜‰)

# About 
This project is still in progress.

## Things i've already done: 
- 3D city map made in blender

As you can see, the version rendered in the browser has some texture issues. I'm going to fix them in the next version.

- Process of making the building and some objects
(I donâ€™t have a video of creating the ancient ruins, river, and bridge because the process took so long that even if I had recorded it, it would have been too long to edit.)
